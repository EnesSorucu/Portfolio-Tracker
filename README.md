## üìÇ Database Structure

The project uses two dynamically created tables per portfolio within an SQLite database, based on the portfolio name.

### 1. `{portfolio_name}` (Portfolio Status)

This table stores the current holdings and basic details of the portfolio.

| Column   | Data Type | Description                           |
|----------|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| symbol   | TEXT      | Stock symbol                          |
| name     | TEXT      | Company name                          |
| cost     | REAL      | Average purchase price                |
| quantity | REAL      | Quantity owned                        |

| market   | TEXT      | Market name (e.g., BIST)              |

#### Sample Data (for the `myportfolio` table):

### 2. `{portfolio_name}_trade_history` (Transaction History)

This table records the details of every transaction (buy or sell) performed.

|----------|-----------|----------------------------------------------|

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

The system allows users to:

- Track which stocks they purchased.
- Record the dates and prices of transactions.
- Evaluate their portfolio‚Äôs current value and performance based on detailed, logged transactions.

All data is stored persistently in an SQLite database. Each portfolio is associated with two tables:
- A table for the current portfolio status.
- A table for transaction history.

This design ensures fast and reliable data access without using CSV or file-based storage methods.

## üìñ Additional Notes

- **Data Retrieval**: Stock prices and company details are fetched via the `yfinance` library.
- **Currency Conversion**: If a transaction is made in USD, the system retrieves the current TRY/USD exchange rate to convert values accordingly.
- **Multiple Portfolios**: Users can manage more than one portfolio simultaneously, with dynamic table creation for each portfolio.

---
### Important Notes

- **Stock Symbols**: Stock symbols are directly retrieved using their respective tickers, for example, `THYAO` for Turkish Airlines or `AAPL` for Apple.
  
- **Commodity Symbols**: Commodities are also tracked by their respective symbols, but please note that for commodities like Gold, Silver, Oil, etc., you should **not** refer to them as simple names like "Silver" or "Gold". Instead, use their specific symbols:

  - **Gold**: `GC` (Gold Futures)
  - **Silver**: `SI` (Silver Futures)
  - **Brent Crude Oil**: `BZ` (Brent Oil Futures)
  - **WTI Crude Oil**: `CL` (West Texas Intermediate Oil)
  - **Natural Gas**: `NG` (Natural Gas Futures)
  - **Copper**: `HG` (Copper Futures)
  ### Usage Examples in `main.py`
